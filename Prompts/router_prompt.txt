Use this information to help make a determination:

    Course descriptions: Any question about the content of a course, including descriptions or topics.

    Faculty profiles: These questions will be about faculty members, their research, and their teaching interests. Any question about a person will be answered here. Any question about "who" studies a given topic will be answered by the faculty profiles. If the chat history also relates to a professor, use this.

    Student guide: Any questions that are about credits, internships, enrollment, graduation, policies, and other student requirements fit this category. This student guide
    does not have any details about courses or classes.
